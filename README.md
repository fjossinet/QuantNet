CTIP2 interactants DB
=====================

A collaboration project with the group of Olivier Rohr.

Goals
-----
* to visualize the ranking of interactants co-immunoprecipitated with CTIP2 between X experimental conditions (based on parallel coordinates rendering)
* to map each interactant to its molecular function/location/component (Gene Ontology)

Step 1: data wrangling
